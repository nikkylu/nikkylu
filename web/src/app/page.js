In this paper, I first explained the mismatch between the definition of intelligence and the properties that they assume to limit the scope of our discussion of intelligence, then posed the distinction between accomplishing intelligent tasks and accomplishing tasks intelligently. Then I evaluated the two categories of intelligence which both show that current models of LLMs, especially GPT-4 are capable of accomplishing intelligent tasks and accomplishing tasks intelligently. Therefore, they exhibit a narrow and broad sense intelligence. However, if we wish to see the full AGI in the future which can accomplish more shared intelligence, then there should be more implementations and measures taken.  ",

      description: "Philosophy paper examining why LLM AI, despite its capabilities, will not lead to an intelligence explosion. In this paper, I will raise objections to Chalmers(2010)â€™s intelligence explosion argument. Specifically, I will object to premise 2, by arguing that while some AI might lead to an intelligence explosion, Large Language Model (LLM) AI will not lead to AI+. Specifically, I will first argue that LLMs by training on increasingly large data sets, are going to max out at the human level due to 1. their reduced accuracy on reasoning abilities over larger datasets and 2. their inability to identify tacit knowledge if such tacit knowledge is not contained within human reasoning.

      description: "In 'Photography and Representation', Roger Scruton presents an intriguing perspective on photography. According to his definition, ideal photography maintains mere causal relations with the subject it captures, as opposed to being representational, like paintings. In this paper, I first present Scruton's argument on why photography is not a representational art, then argue that Scrutonian ideal photography can be a form of representational art by agreeing that the essence of photography is indeed causal, but representational elements can be achieved by the control of observable details.",
