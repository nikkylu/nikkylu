### Hey!

I'm Nikky, a researcher interested in language and mind from both computational and philosophical perspectives. My work is strongly motivated by philosophical inquiries, to innovatively use computational methods in exploring human ways of learning and understanding.

### Current Research

I'm conducting computational research on goal-directed behaviors, advised by Professor Brenden Lake and my mentor, Guy Davidson. Research is funded by NIH grant.

### Thesis

I'm also working on my honors thesis in philosophy, on The Vector Grounding Problem, co-advised by Professor Matthew Mandelkern and Professor David Chalmers.

### Hobbies

Outside of research, I'm a practicing artist who loves hiking, climbing, and cycling. So far, I‚Äôve solo-backpacked to more than 20 destinations!
